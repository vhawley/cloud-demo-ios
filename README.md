# Groceries
The purpose of this app is to sync a grocery list across devices via iCloud. The user can add an item, the price,  the quantity, and log whether or not the item has been purchased. The user can also delete or rearrange items in the list. Both the items and their order in the list will be synced.

# Instructions
In order to test the iCloud capability, the user needs to deploy the app to at least 2 different devices. Navigation within the app is intuitive through the interface.
